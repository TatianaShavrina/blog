During my work as an NLP-engineer, I always encountered a lot of corpus projects, that are not so publicly well-known and mentioned, yet they are a good source of data for different kinds of research.
Here I share this list with you, not forgetting to include in it more popular projects, of course, so that the list was complete.
Send your callbacks to this post, if you know any dataset or the case of the Russian language, which is not mentioned here!
Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.
