    Hi! I am Tatiana Shavrina and I am a fascinated linguist who has moved to data science.
    
    In this blog we will touch upon various interesting questions that link artificial intelligence and theoretical linguistics, interpretation of the results of machine learning, and also consider frequent NLP-developement errors that could be obvious to linguists (if they would read the code).
   
    So...let's profit from both of the fields and dive into it!
    
    Please, feel free to contact me for a consultation.
